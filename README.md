5. Given an array of unique integers, make the array consecutive, then return the additional number of integers added.

6. Almost Increasing Sequence: Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

7. Matrix Element Sum: Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms available for occupancy. Free rooms & the rooms below the free rooms are unfit for occupancy.


8. All Longest Strings: Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

9. Common Character Count: Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

10. Lucky Ticket: Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

11. Sort by Height: Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

12. String in Parantheses: Given a string containing () enclosing another string; reverse the contents of the () and return the string. Eg:  foo(bar)baz(blim) --> foorabbazmilb

13. Alternating Sums: You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

14. Border to Rectangular Matrix: Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.

15. Array Similarity?: Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays. Given two arrays, check whether they are similar.

16. Array Change: Given an array of integers, on each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing array.
